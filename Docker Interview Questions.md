10. How do you stop all running containers with a single command?

#### **Level 2 - Intermediate**
1. Explain the difference between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` in a Dockerfile.
2. How does Docker manage isolation between containers?
3. What are some common Docker commands for debugging container issues?
4. How do you create and attach a container to a custom network?
5. What is the purpose of the `docker-compose` command?
6. How can you see the logs of a container in real-time?
7. What are Docker tags, and why are they important?
8. Explain the role of `EXPOSE` in a Dockerfile.
9. What is the difference between `docker run` and `docker exec`?
10. What happens when you delete an image currently in use by a container?

### **2. Conceptual/Deep Dive Questions**
These evaluate the candidate's understanding of Docker concepts and internals.

#### **Level 3 - Advanced**
1. How does Docker ensure portability of applications?
2. What is the difference between `COPY` and `ADD` in a Dockerfile? Provide examples.
3. How do layers in Docker images work, and how does Docker cache layers?
4. Explain Docker networking in detail. How do bridge, host, and overlay networks differ?
5. What is the significance of `docker-compose.override.yml`?
6. What are the common security concerns when using Docker, and how can they be mitigated?
7. What is the `ENTRYPOINT` script, and when should you use it instead of `CMD`?
8. What is the purpose of multi-stage builds in Docker? Provide a real-world example.
9. How does Docker Swarm ensure high availability?
10. Explain how Docker Content Trust (DCT) secures container images.

#### **Level 4 - Expert**
1. How would you design a Dockerized CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application?
2. Explain how resource limits (CPU and memory) are managed in Docker. How would you configure them for containers?
3. Discuss the differences between Kubernetes and Docker Swarm for container orchestration.
4. How would you troubleshoot a container that exits immediately after starting?
5. What are Docker plugins? How do they extend Docker's functionality?
6. How can you secure inter-container communication in a Docker setup?
7. What are the best practices for writing Dockerfiles in production?
8. How does Docker handle persistent storage? Discuss bind mounts vs. named volumes.
9. How can you integrate Docker with a centralized logging system like ELK or Fluentd?
10. Describe the process of debugging a multi-container application running with Docker Compose.

### **3. Scenario-Based Questions**
These assess practical problem-solving skills and are suitable for testing hands-on expertise.

#### **Level 1 - Junior/Entry Level**
1. A container is running but is inaccessible via its exposed port. How would you debug the issue?
2. Your Docker daemon is unresponsive. How would you proceed to identify and resolve the issue?
3. A developer asks for a container with Python installed. How would you create one for them?

#### **Level 2 - Intermediate**
1. You have multiple containers running on the same host. How would you ensure they communicate securely?
2. You are asked to create a Docker Compose file for a Flask application with PostgreSQL. How would you structure it?
3. A containerized application requires frequent log analysis. How would you manage and aggregate logs from multiple containers?
4. A Docker image size is too large. What steps can you take to reduce its size?
5. How would you handle container failures in a production environment?

#### **Level 3 - Advanced**
1. A containerized application has memory leaks. How would you identify and resolve the issue?
2. You need to deploy a high-availability web application using Docker Swarm. Describe the steps.
3. A container is crashing due to a misconfigured environment variable. How would you debug and fix it?
4. An image built on your local machine works fine but fails in production. How would you debug the issue?
5. You are tasked with integrating Docker into an existing CI/CD pipeline. What steps would you take?

#### **Level 4 - Expert**
1. You are tasked with designing a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform. How would Docker be part of your solution?
2. A customerâ€™s application uses Docker but faces scaling issues with stateful services. How would you solve this?
3. How would you monitor Docker containers in a multi-host setup, ensuring logs and metrics are centralized?
4. You are asked to migrate an existing VM-based application to Docker. What steps and considerations are required?
5. In a disaster recovery scenario, how would you ensure containerized applications can quickly recover?
