**structured learning path** for a **fresher-to-master journey** on **Containers** (especially Docker-focused), with each chapter building logically on the previous one:

---

## Containers Mastery Roadmap (Beginner to Pro)

### ** Chapter 1: Introduction to Containers**

* What is a Container?
* VM vs Container (with diagrams)
* Why Containers? (Speed, Isolation, Portability)
* Popular Container Technologies (Docker, Podman, LXC)

---

### ** Chapter 2: Docker Fundamentals**

* What is Docker?
* Architecture: Docker Daemon, Docker CLI, Docker Engine, Images, Containers
* Installing Docker on Linux/Windows/Mac
* First Docker Command: `docker run hello-world`

---

### ** Chapter 3: Working with Docker CLI**

* `docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker stop`, `docker rm`, `docker exec`, `docker logs`
* Interactive vs Detached containers
* Container lifecycle
* `docker top`, `docker inspect`

---

### ** Chapter 4: Docker Images**

* What is a Docker Image?
* Pulling from Docker Hub
* Creating custom images using `Dockerfile`
* Commands in Dockerfile: `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `EXPOSE`
* Image versioning and tagging
* Multi-stage builds (basic)

---

### ** Chapter 5: Docker Volumes and Storage**

* What is persistence?
* Bind Mount vs Volume
* Managing Volumes (`docker volume` commands)
* Use-cases: Database storage, config sharing

---

### ** Chapter 6: Docker Networking**

* Container communication
* Network drivers: bridge, host, overlay, none
* Creating custom networks
* `docker network ls`, `docker network inspect`
* Linking containers in the same network

---

### ** Chapter 7: Docker Compose (Multi-Container Apps)**

* What is Docker Compose?
* Compose file syntax (`docker-compose.yml`)
* `docker-compose up`, `docker-compose down`
* Example: Nginx + PHP + MySQL stack

---

### ** Chapter 8: Dockerizing Real Apps**

* Dockerize a simple Node.js/Java/Python app
* Add Dockerfile, build and run it
* Debugging common container issues
* Dockerizing database-backed apps

---

### ** Chapter 9: Docker Registry**

* Docker Hub basics
* Tagging and pushing images
* Private Docker Registry setup
* Best practices for storing and sharing images

---

### ** Chapter 10: Docker Security Essentials**

* Image vulnerability scanning
* Best practices: non-root user, minimal base images
* Secrets handling (env vars, files)
* Docker Bench Security Tool

---

### ** Chapter 11: Container Orchestration Basics**

> (Optional intro to lead into Kubernetes later)

* Why we need orchestration?
* Overview: Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes

---

### ** Bonus Labs and Projects**

* Lab: Run WordPress + MySQL using Docker Compose
* Lab: Build your own custom Nginx-based image
* Project: Create a DevOps-ready containerized CI pipeline
* Quiz + Real-world troubleshooting scenarios
